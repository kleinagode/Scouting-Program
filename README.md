# Basketball Scout Generation Program
The goal is to make a progam that can pull data from presto spots and update
the stats in the powerpoint that was given beforehand. This idea came about because I did not want to spend too much of my work-study time manualy calculating the desired statisctic for players. 

- There are currently two versions. The first one (1.0) text file based, meaning that you have to manually copy the data from the teams statistics website and paste it into a text file which you would than have to slightly modifiy for the programm to work

- The second version (2.0) is much more advanced. It automatically pulls data from presto sports and adjusts it for you in the background. So there is a lot of time saved.


I expect that more versions of the program will be uploaded
